# Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gestures

Empowering touchless interactions with cutting-edge computer vision and AI

This innovative project transforms your hand gestures into seamless cursor movements and mouse clicks, eliminating the need for traditional input devices. Leveraging advanced OpenCV and TensorFlow frameworks, the Virtual Mouse uses real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition to provide an intuitive and futuristic human-computer interaction experience.

# Key Features:
Hand Tracking: Detect and track hand movements in real-time using AI-powered algorithms.

Gesture Recognition: Recognize predefined gestures for mouse clicks, drags, and scrolls.

Device Independence: Works with any standard webcam, ensuring wide accessibility.

Customizability: Easily extend the functionality by adding new gestures or modifying the existing ones.

Performance Optimized: Lightweight design ensures minimal latency and efficient processing.

Technology Stack:
OpenCV: Real-time computer vision for hand detection and tracking.
TensorFlow: Deep learning models for gesture recognition.
Python: The primary programming language for seamless integration and flexibility.
